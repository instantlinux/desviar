### Desviar - High-security redirection ###

This is a Ruby-based app server built on Sinatra to create
preauthorized time-limited, random URIs used in devops deployment
scripts or in web applications such as confirmation emails.

It operates similarly to TinyURL or the Amazon S3 temporary-URI
feature: provide the tool with the URI to an existing secure resource,
specify a number of seconds you want to authorize references to it,
and you'll get back a temporary URI good for that amount of time.

You can set it up on a DMZ network or in the cloud behind an
iptables/nginx configuration to provide whatever ACL restrictions you
want, and you can reference any source URI (not just those stored on
S3).

Secure content is cached in memory (sqlite3) by default; for
troubleshooting, you can store content in a file.

#### Installation ####

Clone this repo, copy config/config.rb.example to config/config.rb, and
perform the following:

    sudo apt-get install rack libsqlite3-dev
    #  package names above may differ if not using Ubuntu
    sudo gem install bundler
    sudo bundle install
    rackup -p 4567

Default credential of [app](http://localhost:4567) is user _desviar_, pw _password_.

#### Usage ####

Commands:
* /create - generate a new pre-authenticated URI
* /desviar/xxx - retrieve pre-authenticated content (if a URISUFFIX was specified, it must be appended to xxx)
* /list   - display a table of most-recently uploaded URIs
* /link/nnn - retrieve details

Here's an example of creating a new link via _curl_:

    curl --digest --user desviar:password http://localhost:4567/create \
     --data "desviar_redir_uri=http://localhost/test&desviar_expiration=1800&desviar_captcha=1&desviar_notes=testing"
