### Desviar - High-security redirection ###

This is a Ruby tool built on Sinatra to create preauthorized time-limited,
random URIs used in deployment scripts or in web applications such as
confirmation emails.

It operates similarly to the Amazon S3 temporary-URI feature:  provide
the tool with the URI to an existing secure resource, specify a number
of seconds you want to authorize references to it, and you'll get back
a temporary URI good for that amount of time.

Unlike S3, with this tool you can put it behind an iptables/nginx
configuration to provide whatever ACL restrictions you want, and you
can reference any source URI (not just those stored on S3).

Secure content is cached in memory (sqlite3) by default; for
troubleshooting, you can store content in a file.
